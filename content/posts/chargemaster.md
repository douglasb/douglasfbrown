# RCBS Chargemaster Combo 120v | 290.00 Shipped

I love this scale, and it's programable to remember your charges to save a little or a lot of time due to mistakes. Original box, packing and manual included.

- ChargeMaster Powder Dispenser
- ChargeMaster 1500 Electronic Scale
- Power cord with European adaptors
- Instruction manual

I am having issues with the plug adaptors on the cord,it's not snug but used some DT to secure.  I'm sure you might have a better way to deal with it. 

Prices listed are fair and final and I'm not interested in negotiating so if you're wanting to haggle don't reach out and waste your time and mine.
