# 490 ALPHA Brass 6 DASHER OCD : SRP | 530.00 Shipped

Stocking up on Dasher brass for 2023 and my new barrel, but decided to head in another direction. I've broken a few seals, but they are all new - minus 5 pieces from some neck sizing experiments and a sacrafile for the annealing code.  

Prices listed are fair and final and I'm not interested in negotiating so if you're wanting to haggle don't reach out and waste your time and mine.
