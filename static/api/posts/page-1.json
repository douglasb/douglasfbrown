This is perfect for those who like to run highly organzied and it's very customizable with the added removable side pouches.  I used it once in a PRS match.\n\nPrices listed are fair and final and I'm not interested in negotiating so if you're wanting to haggle don't reach out and waste your time and mine. \n\n### Description from Eberlestock's website\nInspired by a champion 3-Gunner who didn’t like the normal sequence of dismounting a pack face-down and rolling the straps in the dirt, the R3 UpRanger™ changes the game. Drop the R3 on its polycarbonate outer face and unzip from the harness side for quick access to everything you need without unnecessary wear or dirt. Whether you use it for the range, or a durable and secure camera bag, the R3 UpRanger will take it all. Add on Sidewinder rifle cases for an all-in-one 3-Gun pack.\n\n[Website link](https://eberlestock.com/products/upranger?_pos=3&_sid=03fb181d2&_ss=r)\n\n## The Details  \n|                   |                                                      |\n| ------------------| ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| Condition         | Lightly used                                   |\n| Blemishes         | None                                        |\n| Price             | $250 shipped                                    |\n| Age               | Purchased 6/10/2021                                  |\n| Included          | Waistbelt and additional dividers                    |\n|                   |                                                      |\n\n![upranger!!](/uploads/upranger2.jpg)\n\n![upranger2!!](/uploads/upranger.jpg)\n\n## Purchase Process\n\n1.
