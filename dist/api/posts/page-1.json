I was not paying attention when I ordered this bino pack thinking it was a small. I didn't realize that it was for full size glass until recently as I started preparing for the hunting season. The aformentioned slip pocket can hold a carry handgun but it puts it up pretty high for a quick grab. I chose to carry elsewhere.\n\n### Description from Eberlystock's website \nThe Scout Bino Pack™ is an ultralight binocular harness and carrier system designed with a minimalistic mindset. It features a magnetic closure to make it easy and quiet to access your binos. There’s a quick-access slip pocket on the backside to hold a handgun or rangefinder. The improved 3D mesh harness is comfortable and breathable and can be worn under a pack or removed to use the APSK Chest Pouch Mount Kit™\n\n[Website link](https://eberlestock.com/collections/bino-harnesses/products/scout-bino-pack-large?variant=17183232131123)\n\n## The Details\n|                   |                                                      |\n| ------------------| ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| Condition         | New but removed from plastic wrap                                   |\n| Blemishes         | None                                        |\n| Price             | $75 shipped                                    |\n| Age               | Purchased 8/10/2021                                  |\n| Included          | Harness                 |\n|                   |                                                      |\n\n![bino1!!](/uploads/binoClosed.jpg)\n\n![bino2!!](/uploads/binoOpen.jpg)\n\n![bino3!!](/uploads/binoFlat.jpg)\n\n## Purchase Process\nSOLD\n## Contact\nReach out to me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/douglasbrownca) and DM me if you're intersted or use the post from Snipers Hide.","isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","status":"SOLD","title":"Eberlystock Large Scout Bino Pack","subtitle":"Never Used","category":["SOLD"],"author":"Douglas Brown","price":"$75.00 shipped","date":"2022-08-26T19:59:59.000Z","featureImage":"/uploads/ebBinoPack.jpg","slug":"eberlystockBino"},{"content":"# UpRanger | 215.00 Shipped\n### This is an awesome pack for PRS\n\nI found that I'm an old school and prefer a one chamber pack which seems to be personal preferece.
