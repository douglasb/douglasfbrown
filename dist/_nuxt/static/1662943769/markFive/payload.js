I'd keep this for my hunting rifle, but it's just too much glass for me.  It's outstanding for long distance shooting, like for F Class, which was the original intent when I bought the scope. Goals changed.  The optics are oustanding -- I'm shooting with a Athon Cronus and it's good, but not like this one. I'd buy another one and probably will down the road, but something more appropriate for hunting.  Leopold comes with a lifetime warranty. \n\n## The Details\n\n|                   |                                                      |\n| ------------------| ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| Condition         | Used                              |\n| Blemishes         | Wear and tear on the Turret             |\n| Price             | 1590.00 Includes Shipping Lower 48 and insurance             |\n| Purchase Date     | Purchased 8\u002F12\u002F2021                                  |\n\n![brass-annealer1!!](\u002Fuploads\u002FmarkFive1.jpg)\n\n![brass-annealer2!!](\u002Fuploads\u002FmarkFive2.jpg)\n\n![brass-annealer3!!](\u002Fuploads\u002FmarkFive3.jpg)\n\n![brass-annealer4!!](\u002Fuploads\u002FmarkFive4.jpg)\n\n![brass-annealer5!!](\u002Fuploads\u002FmarkFiveBlemish.jpg)\n|               |       |\n|---------------|-------|\n| Scope Weight: | 33 oz |\n| Scope Length: |15.7\" |\n| Magnification Range |7 - 35x |\n| Scope Objective Diameter: | 56mm |\n| Scope Tube Size \u002F Mount: | 35mm |\n| Turret Adjustment (Click Value): |.25 MOA Per Click |\n| Elevation Turret Details: | M1C3 100 MOA |\n| Windage Turret Details: | 50 MOA |\n| Parallax Adjustment: | 50 yards - infinity |\n| Reticle Position: | First Focal Plane |\n| Reticle Details: | Impact 60 MOA Reticle |\n| Field of View: | 14.7 feet @ 100 yards (low magnification) 3 feet @ 100 yards (high magnification) |\n| Eye Relief: |  3.6 inches (low magnification)  3.8 inches (high magnification) |\n| Illuminated Reticle: | No |\n| Scope Finish: | Black |\n| Scope Turret Rotation: | Counter Clockwise (CCW) |\n\n\n## Purchase Process\n\n1.
