I was not paying attention when I ordered this bino pack thinking it was a small. I didn't realize that it was for full size glass until recently as I started preparing for the hunting season. The aformentioned slip pocket can hold a carry handgun but it puts it up pretty high for a quick grab. I chose to carry elsewhere.\n\n### Description from Eberlystock's website \nThe Scout Bino Pack™ is an ultralight binocular harness and carrier system designed with a minimalistic mindset. It features a magnetic closure to make it easy and quiet to access your binos. There’s a quick-access slip pocket on the backside to hold a handgun or rangefinder. The improved 3D mesh harness is comfortable and breathable and can be worn under a pack or removed to use the APSK Chest Pouch Mount Kit™\n\n[Website link](https:\u002F\u002Feberlestock.com\u002Fcollections\u002Fbino-harnesses\u002Fproducts\u002Fscout-bino-pack-large?variant=17183232131123)\n\n## The Details\n|                   |                                                      |\n| ------------------| ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| Condition         | New but removed from plastic wrap                                   |\n| Blemishes         | None                                        |\n| Price             | $75 shipped                                    |\n| Age               | Purchased 8\u002F10\u002F2021                                  |\n| Included          | Harness                 |\n|                   |                                                      |\n\n![bino1!!](\u002Fuploads\u002FbinoClosed.jpg)\n\n![bino2!!](\u002Fuploads\u002FbinoOpen.jpg)\n\n![bino3!!](\u002Fuploads\u002FbinoFlat.jpg)\n\n## Purchase Process\nSOLD\n## Contact\nReach out to me on [Facebook](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fdouglasbrownca) and DM me if you're intersted or use the post from Snipers Hide.",isEmpty:false,excerpt:"",status:a,title:"Eberlystock Large Scout Bino Pack",subtitle:"Never Used",category:[a],author:"Douglas Brown",price:"$75.00 shipped",date:"2022-08-26T19:59:59.000Z",featureImage:"\u002Fuploads\u002FebBinoPack.jpg",pageType:"post",slug:"eberlystockBino"}]]}}("SOLD")));
